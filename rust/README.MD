# Rust Tutorial for Beginners

Welcome to the Rust Tutorial for Beginners! This tutorial is designed for people who are new to programming or have limited programming experience. We'll be starting from the basics and building up our knowledge of Rust from there.

## Prerequisites

No prior programming experience is required for this tutorial. We'll cover all the concepts you need to know to get started with Rust.



Each section of this tutorial builds on the previous sections, so it is recommended to follow the sections in order.

## Running Rust Code

To run Rust code, you will need to have Rust installed on your computer. Don't worry, we'll walk you through the installation process in the Introduction to Rust section.

Once Rust is installed, you can use the `rustc` compiler to compile your code. We'll cover how to do this in the Variables and Data Types section.
