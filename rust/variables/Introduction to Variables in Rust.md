**Introduction to Variables in Rust**



Variables are used in Rust to store values that can be used throughout a program. A variable is a named memory location that holds a value. In Rust, variables are created using the `let` keyword.

In this tutorial, we will cover the basics of variables in Rust, including how to declare and initialize variables, data types, and more advanced topics like mutable variables and variable scope. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a solid understanding of how variables work in Rust and be able to use them effectively in your own programs.
