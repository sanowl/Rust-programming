**introduction to Data Types in Rust****


Every programming language has a set of built-in data types that you can use to define variables and structures in your code. Rust is no different, and it provides a rich set of data types to work with. In this file, we'll cover the basics of data types in Rust.


*Basic Data Types*
Rust has several built-in basic data types, including:

bool: A boolean type that can be either true or false.
char: A single Unicode character, enclosed in single quotes.
i8, i16, i32, i64, i128: Signed integers of different sizes.
u8, u16, u32, u64, u128: Unsigned integers of different sizes.
f32, f64: Floating-point numbers of different sizes.
Compound Data Types
Rust also provides several compound data types, which allow you to group multiple values together. These include:

Arrays: Fixed-size collections of elements of the same type.
Tuples: Fixed-size collections of elements of different types.
Structs: Custom data types that can contain fields of different types.
Type Inference
In Rust, you don't always have to explicitly specify the type of a variable or expression. Rust's type inference system can often deduce the type of a value based on the context in which it's used.

For example, if you write let x = 42;, Rust will infer that x has the type i32, because 42 is an integer literal. Similarly, if you write let y = "hello";, Rust will infer that y has the type &str, because "hello" is a string literal.

*Conclusion*
Understanding data types is a fundamental part of programming in Rust. By knowing the basics of Rust's built-in data types and how to use them, you'll be well on your way to writing efficient, type-safe Rust code.
